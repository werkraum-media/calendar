Features

Nothing

Fixes
-----

* Fix broken month view if last week of December is in next year.

  The cause was using the wrong character in formatting the year.
  We now switch from `Y` to `o` which will work based on the week instead of date.
  This is necessary as we provide this year to the week,
  and therefore need the year of the week, not day.

Tasks
-----

* Adopt functional tests for latest TYPO3.

  TYPO3 now would return a 404 if cHash doesn't match.
  We now exclude the parameters within our functional tests to not run into this issue.

Deprecation
-----------

Nothing
